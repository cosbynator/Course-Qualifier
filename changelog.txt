---------------------
- Fixed a bug with the new Dubai campus courses screwing up my parsing
  algorithm
- Refactored the data model for conflicts
- Added a bunch of unit tests to do code cleanup
- Lots of code sanitization. I'm anticipating passing this site onto another
  group to take care of after I graduate, we'll see how it goes. If it falls
  through and possibly if it doesn't I'll open source the code on github.
- Updated YUI to 2.8.1. Made some slight stylistic changes

/ November 21, 2009 /

/ October 10, 2009 /
--------------------

  type "ARTS" as the name and "*" as the code.

/ March 14, 2009   /
--------------------
- Fixed a bug that didn't allow multiple times for a single course per day
- Fixed a bug where certain evening classes showed as morning and vice-versa
  (I have to guess at this because waterloo specifies times in 12-hour clock with
   no AM/PM. Amazing)
- Happy \pi day!

--------------------
/ January 28, 2009 /
-------------------
- Fixed Safari bugs on stats page and main page

-------------------

--------------------
/ January 7, 2009 /
-------------------

  the 11:30 slot and the 12:00 slot but not the 12:30
- Added start times to the list of related info about the class

--------------------
/ November 3, 2008 /
-------------------
- Added "Show full courses" (defaulted to yes) into advanced options
- Added back "lateness" into the computed metrics. This how close you are
  to having all classes start at midnight (thanks to Jordan Macdonald for
  both)

--------------------
/ October 14, 2008 /
------------------
Code has been entirely rewritten. If I can remember:

Back end:
- Full rewrite
- Supports graduate courses (this is transparent)
- Logs all requests to generate statistics (user viewable)
- JSON is used for all communications back and forth
- Rate My Professors data is maintained in a database and displayed via
  the average rate my professors metric in the front end
- Added the "required days" metric 
- Supports Saturday/Sunday courses
- Added "Blow up" detection. A innocent sounding courseload like MATH 136, 
  MATH 138, ECON 101 can result in over 250,000 schedules. Rather than
  melt servers, I now display an error message telling you of the foolishness
- Added "Add Course" for those of us taking over 6 courses

Front end:
- Full rewrite, switched from the Dojo Javascript toolkit to the
  Yahoo! User Interface Library
- Added the "Advanced Options" popup (most people won't need it)
- Supports restriction of specific sections, say MATH 135 section 101 and
  tutorial 001
- By popular request added a PDF version of the schedules
- Made a nicer detailed display of courses (seeing the section number, etc.)
- De-pompousified the description of the course qualifier

Bugs fixed:
????

/ May 25, 2008 /
--------------
Features Added:
- Did a version bump on all the "session" parameters to reflect upcoming
terms. Also, I'm using the names instead of the seemingly random numbers
Waterloo assigns.

Notes:
- Has been almost a year now with no major updates (my last co-op ate up a lot
of time). In one way it is good that the program has held up, but in another
way I'd like to make some bigger changes. I have a new version in development
with some nice backend changes, but the latest version of the Dojo toolkit
hasn't impressed me with the quality of the grid widget. I'm going to look
into using the Yahoo Ajax Toolkit before making a call.

- Next version should have support for Laurier courses as well.

 --------------
/June 22, 2007/
-------------
Bugs fixed:
-Fixed timer when "double" clicking the make it so button. Now counts at an 
 accurate rate (thanks Ivan Joukov)
-Will now abort previous request when a new request is made (thanks Ivan Joukov)
-Fixed lumping of non-lecture, non-tutorial, non-test courses into one column 
 (thanks Stan Nikiforov)
-Finally fixed the annoying issue of classes with staggered lecture
 times not being displayed correctly (thanks Robert Burke and Abinav Patel)

New features:
-Added option of hiding distance education courses
-Started this changelog :)

Notes: Probably the last version without a major restructure
