(Waterloo) Course Qualifier
See LICENSE for licensing information (GPLv2)

Usage:
    - Unzip the package to a folder that is exposed by a web server. Make sure
      that .py is configured to be handled by CGI (provided by my .htaccess)
    - Bootstrap the statistics database (instructions are in script/readme.txt)
    - Ensure that the databases are writable by the server process. Ensure that
      qualifyCGI.py and makePDFCalendarCGI.py are executable. Ensure that all 
      other files are 755
    - Check the shebang lines on qualifyCGI.py and makePDFCalendarCGI.py to make
      sure they point at a valid python installation
    - Visiting ROOT/index.html will make an AJAX request to one of the CGI
      scripts and everything should go smoothly.
    - The statistics web page can be generated by 
        "python WaterlooStats.py -f 'outputfile.html'"
    
Course qualifier depends on:
    - BeautifulSoup (tested version 3.0.x - the developer considers the 3.1
                     line a failed experiment. I've included a good version in
                     the modules directory)
    - pysqlite2 (tested version 2.5.5)
    - ReportLab (tested version 2.4)
    - simplejson (tested version 2.1.x)

Statistics depends on the above, and:
    - Mako (tested 0.2.5)
