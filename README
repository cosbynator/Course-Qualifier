(Waterloo) Course Qualifier
See LICENSE for licensing information (GPLv2)

Usage:
    - Unzip the package to a folder that is exposed by a web server. Make sure
      that .py is configured to be handled by CGI (provided by my .htaccess)
    - Bootstrap the statistics database (instructions are in script/readme.txt)
    - Ensure that the databases are writable by the server process. Ensure that
      qualifyCGI.py and makePDFCalendarCGI.py are executable. Ensure that all 
      other files are 755
    - Copy config/qualifier.cfg.example to config/qualifier.cfg and visit uwdata.ca
      to get your own API key.
    - Check the shebang lines on qualifyCGI.py and makePDFCalendarCGI.py to make
      sure they point at a valid python installation
    - Visiting ROOT/index.html will make an AJAX request to one of the CGI
      scripts and everything should go smoothly.
    - The statistics web page can be generated by 
        "python WaterlooStats.py -f 'outputfile.html'"
